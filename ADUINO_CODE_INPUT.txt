/* distance between two ir sensors 10cm= 0.01m (1m= 100cm)
 * since time is in millisecond. So to change it to m per second we will have to multiply the whole thing with 1000
 * (0.10/time_for_speed)*1000
 * Now this speed is m/s which we will convert in km/h and for that multiply it by 18/5 or 3.6 (both are same)
 * ((0.10/time_for_speed)*1000)*18/5
 * after solving it, we will get 216/time_for_speed ....................... finish
 * If you placing two ir at 5cm apart then you would choose 0.05 instead of 0.06 
 * Do the same for other distance between two ir sensors

// Note 2

/* Variable active is used so that detected speed would be print on the screen only for one time because printing the same detected speed is illogical 
 * active becomes 1 whilte calucation of speed or velocity but once printed on screen it goes to low which makes the execution of printing commands to execute
 * only one time for one detection
